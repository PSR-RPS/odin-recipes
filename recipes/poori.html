        <h2>Soft and tasty Poori</h2>
        <p><strong>Puri is a deep-fried bread</strong> made from unleavened whole-wheat flour that originated in the Indian subcontinent. It is eaten for breakfast or as a snack or light meal. <em>It is usually served with a savory curry or bhaji,</em> as in puri bhaji, but may also be eaten with sweet dishes</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Wheat flour</li>
            <li>Refiened Flour/li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add 1 cup whole wheat flour, ¾ teaspoon fine rava (semolina or suji) and 1/8 teaspoon salt to a mixing bowl. You can also skip rava and salt. If using milled flour (atta from flour mill) then do sieve and discard the bran.</li>
            <li>Pour ¾ teaspoon oil. Mix all of them well & pour ¼ cup water (4 tablespoons).</li>
            <li>Begin to mix to form a stiff dough. You will need another 1 to 2 tablespoons water. Sprinkle more water only as needed.</li>
            <li>Make a stiff & tight dough that is not crumbly or dry. It must not be soft like the roti dough.</li>
            <li>Drizzle another ¼ teaspoon oil and knead lightly to just smoothen the ball.</li>
            <li>Keep this dough covered always until all of the dough is used up to roll pooris.</li>
            <li>Gently roll them in between your palms just to make them smooth.</li>
            <li>Fry the rolled poories and serv hot</li>
        </ol>
